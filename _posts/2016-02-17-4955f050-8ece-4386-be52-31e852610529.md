I am currently a user experience researcher at Microsoft, in the Surface tablet team. I was previously working in the Developers Division on a variety of things including the Team Foundation Server product for managing large software projects, the Windows 8 development experience, the C++ Developer experience, and the help and community experience. On this website, you will find information about my job as an academic researcher and as a user experience researcher and designer. You can check out the research section for details about my research projects, including my [Ph.D. thesis (in English)][0] and[markerClock][1]

. You can also visit my [publication section][2] to know more about my published research work.

I live in the Seattle area and I am always interested to hear about exciting, innovative projects that need a user-centered perspective. If you want to have a broad overview of my past projects, you can visit my [portfolio section][3] describing some of my work in user experience and human computer interaction in general. Finally, you can visit my photography [website][4]to see some of my artwork.
